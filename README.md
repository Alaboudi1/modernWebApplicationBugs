# Modern Web Application Bugs

## Getting Started:

_Your project needs to be configured to run side-by-side with Hypothesizer. We have provided an example repository containing modern web application bugs to try the debugger for yourself._

1. Create a local directory for this repo on your machine
```bash
mkdir modernWebApplicationBugs
```

2. Clone the repo from [here](https://github.com/Alaboudi1/modernWebApplicationBugs)
```bash
cd modernWebApplicationBugs
git clone https://github.com/Alaboudi1/modernWebApplicationBugs.git
```

3. Install the dependencies with yarn:
```bash
yarn
```

## Running an example Web-App:

_Now itâ€™s time to get an application running on localhost:3000, this is where Hypothesizer will look for an application when it starts up._

1. Change Directory to bug-1 and install the dependencies
```bash
cd bug-1
yarn
```

2. Run the application
```bash
yarn start
```

_Congrats! You now have a web application running on localhost:3000
The process is the same for all the other web apps in the repo, if not, it will be stated in the individual projects README.md file._
